# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

# Overview

In this challenge we will be using neural networks to help make the decising of which companies Alphabet Soup will be funding. To do this will be using tensorflow. 

# Results

Form the dataset we determined that the main variable form the the dataset is the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column. We also removed the uncessary columns such as the EIN and NAME this is to have a cleaner dataset and to help the model perfom smoother. 

In the first attempt I set up the neural network with 8 neurons in the first layer and 6 in the second layer. 
This were the results:

In the 2nd attempt I set up the neural network with 10 neurons in the first layer and 8 in the second layer. 
This were the results:

In the 3rd attempt I set up the neural network with 12 neurons in the first layer and 8 in the second layer. 
This were the results:

# Summary 

After three attemps we were not able to create a model that would reach 75% accuracy rating. We could have continue setting different convinations of neurons to get the results desired.
